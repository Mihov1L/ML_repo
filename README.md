# Car Price Prediction using Regression Model


## Description

This project aims to predict car prices using one of the most accurate regression models (XGBoost regression) for the required task. The goal is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on various features such as kilometers driven, age, fuel type, and other relevant factors. This README file provides an overview of the project and its components.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various cars and their corresponding prices.
